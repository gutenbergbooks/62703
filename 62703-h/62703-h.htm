<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>A small house in the country. The action passes on
Christmas Day, 1933. The audience is asked to imagine that the
recommendations of the</i> Majority Report of the Royal Commission on
Divorce <i>v.</i> Matrimonial Causes <i>have become the law of the land</i>.</p></div>

<p><a href="#ACT_I">ACT I</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Hall. Morning.</span></p>

<p><a href="#ACT_II">ACT II</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Drawing Room. Early Afternoon.</span></p>

<p><a href="#ACT_III">ACT III</a>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Hall. Late Afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_1" id="page_1">{1}</a></span></span></p>

<h2><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>The curtain rises on the hall, obviously used as the common-room
of a country house. On the right (of the audience) is the outer
door and a staircase that runs down from an upper landing towards
the middle of the room, half hiding what has once been a separate
smaller room with a baize door at the back. In the corner a French
window opens on to a snowbound garden. On the left, facing the
entrance, a log fire is blazing. Staircase, pictures, grandfather
clock, etc., are wreathed with holly and mistletoe. At the
breakfast table, which is laid for three and littered with paper
and string, sit</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Hester Fairfield</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret Fairfield</span>,
<i>her niece by marriage. The third chair has two or three parcels
piled up on it.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hester Fairfield</span> <i>is one of those twitching, high-minded, elderly
ladies in black, who keep a grievance as they might keep a pet
dog&mdash;as soon as it dies they replace it by another. The grievance
of the moment seems to be the empty third chair, and</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret
Fairfield</span> <i>is, as usual, on the defensive. Such a little, pretty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span>
helpless-looking woman as</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>has generally half a dozen big
sons and a husband to bully; but</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>has only a daughter,
and her way of looking at even the chair on which that daughter
ought to be sitting, is the way of a child whose doll has suddenly
come to life. For the rest, she is so youthfully anxious and simple
and charming that the streak of grey in her hair puzzles you. You
wonder what trouble has fingered it. It does not occur to you that
she is quite thirty-five.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Apologising</i>] Yes, she is late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> As usual!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, well, she was dancing till three. I hadn’t the heart to
wake her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Till three, was she? Who brought her home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Kit, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Three o’clock on Christmas morning! I wonder what the
Rector said to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, Kit’s on holiday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I heard you tell her myself to be in by twelve. If
anything could make me approve of this marriage of yours&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, don’t begin it again, Auntie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span>&mdash;it’s that the child will have a strong hand over her at
last. A step-father’s better than nothing&mdash;if you can call him a
step-father when her father’s still alive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> What’s the use of saying “don’t”? He <i>is</i> alive. You
can’t get away from that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Aunt Hester&mdash;<i>please</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Well, I’m only telling you&mdash;if it’s got to be, I’m not
sorry it’s Gray Meredith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Smiling</i>] Yes, Sydney knows just how far she may go with
Gray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I see nothing to laugh at in that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s so funny to think how circumspect you all are with him.
He’s the one person I’ve always felt perfectly safe with. I’d ask
anything of Gray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Grimly</i>] You always have, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I don’t know why you should be unkind to me on Christmas
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>With a sort of grudging affection</i>] I suppose it’s
because I’ve only got another week to be unkind to you in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Restlessly</i>] Oh, I wish you didn’t hate it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> My dear, when you see a person you care for, and she
your own nephew’s wife, on the brink of deadly sin&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Must we begin it again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I do my duty. If you’d done yours your daughter wouldn’t
be late for breakfast, and I shouldn’t be given the opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Perhaps I <i>had</i> better call her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Everything getting cold&mdash;and so disrespectful! She ought
to be taught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Rising with a sigh</i>] You’re quite right. [<i>Calling at the
foot of the stairs</i>] Sydney, darling, shall I bring you up your coffee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney’s Voice.</span> [<i>Answering</i>] It’s all right, Mother! I’m coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> And I suppose that’s all you’ll say.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>comes out of her room. She is physically a bigger, fairer
edition of</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, <i>but there the likeness ends. Her manner is
brisk and decided. She is very sure of herself, but when she loses
her temper, as she often does, she loses her aplomb and reveals the
schoolgirl. Her attitude to the world is that of justice,
untempered, except where her mother is in question, by mercy. But
she is very fond of her mother.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Running down the stairs</i>] Merry Christmas, everyone! I’m not
late, am I? Morning, Auntie! What, no post?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It gets later every year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I’m very much obliged to you, Sydney, for
the&mdash;card-case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Undoing her parcels</i>] It’s a cigarette case, Auntie dear. You
see, I thought if you gave me a prayer-book again we might do a deal.
Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> I thought so! Thanks most awfully. It’s sweet of you. Shall we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Swop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney, dear, that’s rather rude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Swiftly</i>] Well, Mother, I hate being hinted at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Bewildered</i>] Hint? What hint?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, Mother, you’re such a lamb. You never see anything. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield</span>] I’m sorry, Auntie, but I’m seventeen, and I’ve left
school, and I am not going to church to-day, or any day any more ever,
except to chaperon Mother and Gray next week, bless ’em!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I do think, Margaret, she ought at least to call him
Uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Aren’t you coming with us to-day, darling? Christmas Day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Sorry, Mother. It’s against my principles. I refuse to kneel
down and say I’m a miserable sinner. I’m not miserable and I’m not a
sinner, and I cannot tell a lie to please any old&mdash;prayer-book. Besides,
I’m expecting Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> You’ll find that Kit takes his mother to church. <i>She</i>
hasn’t lost all her influence&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Darkly</i>] She’ll be finding herself up against me soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Like a schoolgirl</i>] Oh, Sydney, has he&mdash;?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> He’s trying his hardest to, but I like to sort of <i>spread</i> my
jam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Then&mdash;then&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I’m not actually engaged, if you mean that&mdash; [<i>Watching their
faces mischievously</i>] but I’m going to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Engaged at seventeen! Preposterous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Instantly</i>] Mother was married at seventeen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> That was the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I don’t see what that’s got to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Timidly</i>] Sydney&mdash;at seventeen, one doesn’t know enough&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> One doesn’t know the same things, I dare say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> One doesn’t know anything at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes, but think of the hopeless sort of world you were seventeen
in&mdash;even you. As for poor Auntie, as far as knowing things goes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney, my dear, be good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I am being good. I’m returning hint for hint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Ruffling</i>] Is this the way you let your daughter speak
to me, Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Closing with her</i>] You see, she doesn’t enjoy being hinted at
either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Between the upper and the nether mill-stone</i>] I don’t know
what you mean, Sydney, but <i>don’t</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I mean that I’m not going to let Aunt Hester interfere in my
affairs like she does in yours. That’s what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> These are the manners they teach you at your fine
school, I suppose!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Never mind, Auntie, I’ve had my lessons in the holidays too. You
needn’t think I haven’t watched the life you’ve led Mother over this
divorce business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Distressed at the discussion</i>] Sydney! Sydney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Remorselessly</i>] Well, hasn’t she? What prevented you from
marrying Gray ages ago? Father’s been out of his mind long enough, poor
man! You knew you were free to be free. You knew you were making Gray
miserable and yourself miserable&mdash;and yet, though that divorce law has
been in force for years, it’s taken you all this time to fight your
scruples. At least, you call them scruples! What you really mean is Aunt
Hester and her prayer book. And now, when you have at last consented to
give yourself a chance of being happy&mdash;when it’s Christmas Day and
you’re going to be married at New Year&mdash;still you let Aunt Hester sit at
your own breakfast table and insult you with talk about deadly sin. It’s
no use pretending you didn’t Auntie, because Mother left my door open
and I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>With a certain dignity</i>] Sydney, I can take care of myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Oblivious of it</i>] Take care of yourself! As if everybody
didn’t ride rough-shod over you when I’m not there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes, but my pet, you musn’t break out like this. Of course
your aunt knows you don’t really mean to be rude&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I do mean to be rude to her when she’s rude to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> My dear, you quite misunderstand your aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, no, I don’t, Mother! [<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>shrugs her shoulders
helplessly and sits down on the sofa to the left of the fireplace</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Rising</i>] I’m afraid you’ll have to go to church
without me, Margaret. I’m thoroughly upset. You’ve brought up your
daughter to ignore me, and I know why. I’m the wrong side of the family.
I’m the one person in this house who remembers poor Hilary. I shall read
the service in the drawing-room. [<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Looking after her</i>] She owes me something. She’s been dying
for an excuse, with that cold. [<i>She turns to the sofa and says more
gently</i>] What’s the use of crying, Mother? If Gray finds out there’ll be
a row, and then Aunt Hester’ll be sorry she ever was born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It isn’t that. You get so excited, Sydney! You remind me&mdash;your
father was so excitable. I don’t like to see it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I’m not really. I needn’t let myself go if I don’t want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You musn’t get impatient with your aunt. She can’t get
accustomed to the new ways, that’s all. I&mdash;I can’t myself, sometimes.
[<i>Restlessly</i>] I hope I’m doing right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, I do think it’s morbid to have a conscience. If Father had
been dead fifteen years, would you say, “I hope I’m doing right”? And he
<i>is</i> dead. His mind’s dead. You know you’ve done all you can. And you’re
frightfully in love with Gray&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Flushing</i>] Don’t, Sydney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well, you are, and so he is with you. So what’s the worry about?
Aunt Hester! What people like Aunt Hester choose to think! I call it
morbid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Whimsically</i>] I suppose I haven’t brought you up properly.
Your aunt’s quite right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes. That’s what it always comes back to. “Your aunt’s quite
right!” I can argue with you by the hour&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Hastily</i>] Oh, not this morning, darling, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span>&mdash;and Gray can argue with you by the hour&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Smiling</i>] Ah, but he never does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span>&mdash;and you pretend to agree with us; but underneath your common
sense, your mind’s really thinking&mdash;“Your aunt’s quite right!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> She stands for the old ways, Sydney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> She stands for Noah and the flood. She’d no business to go
dragging up Father and the divorce on Christmas morning to upset you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It wasn’t your aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Then it was me, I suppose! “If I could only control my tongue
and my temper,” and all the rest of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Quietly</i>] No, it was about Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Kit? Oh, that’s all right, Mother. Don’t you worry about me and
Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You needn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Shyly</i>] You see, I thought I was in love at seventeen, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, but I quite know what I’m doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> And now I know I didn’t know much about it. I don’t want you
to be&mdash;rushed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Nobody could make me do what I didn’t want to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Forgetting</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>] It was nobody’s fault. It was the
war&mdash; [<i>She sits, dreaming.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s extraordinary to me&mdash;whenever you middle-aged people want
to excuse yourselves for anything you’ve done that you know you oughtn’t
to have done, you say it was the war. How could a war make you get
married if you didn’t want to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Groping for words</i>] It was the feel in the air. They say the
smell of blood sends horses crazy. That was the feel. One did mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span>
things. Hilary&mdash;your father&mdash;he was going out&mdash;the trenches&mdash;to be hurt.
And he was so fond of me he frightened me. I was so sorry. I thought I
cared. Can’t you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> No. Either you care or you don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Passionately</i>] How can you know until it happens to you? How
was I to know there was more to it than keeping house and looking after
Hilary&mdash;and you? How was I to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Doubtfully</i>] Is there so much more to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I don’t believe there is for some people. Why it’s just what I
want&mdash;to look after Kit and a house of my own, and&mdash;oh, at least half a
dozen kids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Uncomfortably</i>] Sydney, <i>dear</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, Kit’s as keen as I am on eugenics. He’s doing a paper for
his debating society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Well, I found you quite enough to manage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Leaning over the back of the sofa</i>] I believe you were scared
of me when I was little&mdash; [<i>Margaret nods</i>] and even now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Quickly</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Quite good humoured about it</i>] Well, if you had to choose
between me and Gray, it wouldn’t be Gray who’d lose you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Confronted with the idea</i>] I hope I’d do what’s right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Airily</i>] There you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>As it goes home</i>] It’s not true. You’ve no right to make me
out a heartless mother. But&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Her arm round her mother’s neck</i>] Well&mdash;heartless Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Clutching at the arm</i>] Oh, Sydney&mdash;what should I do if
Gray&mdash;if Gray&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s all right, Mother! [<i>There is the sound of a motor driving

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Jumping up hurriedly</i>] Oh, and I’m not dressed. Say I’ll be
down in a minute. [<i>She runs upstairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You’ve plenty of time. The bells haven’t begun yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>From the gallery</i>] Tell Bassett to clear away.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>rings the bell. The elderly maid enters through the baize

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> Yes, Miss?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You can clear, Bassett!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>While she is speaking</i> <span class="smcap">Gray Meredith</span> <i>comes in through the hall

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Putting down a box he carries</i>] Where’s your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Folding her hands</i>] Good morning, dear Sydney! A merry
Christmas to you, and so many thanks for the tie that, with the help of
your devoted aunt, you so thoughtfully&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Stop it, there’s a good child! I haven’t missed her, have I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Pray accept in return as a small token of esteem and total
dependency&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> I asked you if your mother had started.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>In her natural voice</i>] It’s true, you know. You simply daren’t
cope with me yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Twinkling in spite of himself</i>] Hm! A time will come&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Wouldn’t it warm the cockles of Aunt Hester’s heart to hear you!
What are cockles, Gray? Gray, she says I ought to call you Uncle! Gray,
d’you think you have brought me what I think you have for a Christmas
present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You’d better go and look. It’s in the motor with Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> He.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>At the door</i>] Oh, didn’t I tell you? Mother says she’ll be

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It will be&mdash;oh, it will be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> I almost think it will sometimes. [<i>Holding her at arms’ length</i>]
New frock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Oh, I’ve seen it already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Why, it’s the first time I’ve put it on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Untying the box on the table as he speaks</i>] Sydney carted it

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Looks like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, I hope you haven’t been extravagant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Don’t call me Meg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You never have before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Don’t you see, I want a name for you that no-one else uses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Close to him</i>] Yes, yes, that no-one else has ever used. Not
Meg. Not Margaret. Make a name of your own for me&mdash;new&mdash;new.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Well, you’re getting one new name pretty soon, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes. New year&mdash;new name&mdash;new life. [<i>In his arms</i>] Oh, Gray,
is thirty-five very old?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Not when you say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, Gray, we’ve time for everything still?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Time for everything. [<i>He laughs</i>] Except church, my child! Do you
really insist on going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Aunt Hester will be horrified if I don’t. Besides&mdash; [<i>She comes
back to the table and begins putting the papers together.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I suppose you’ll think me a fool&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Shall I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, Gray, for the first time in my life I’m happy. I want to
say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What does she want to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> “Humble and hearty thanks&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Mother! Mother! Look what Gray’s brought me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, Sydney, your aunt isn’t fond of dogs. Merry Christmas,

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Merry Christmas, Mrs. Fairfield!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes, but isn’t he an angel? And Kit’s given me a collar for him.

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Earnestly, as he goes out through the baize door</i>] He ought to be

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Calling to him</i>] Just one to gnaw. [<i>Then, over her shoulder</i>]
Mother, the bells have been going quite a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gray</span>] Listen, don’t you love them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Church bells?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Wedding bells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Margaret, you’ve stepped straight out of a Trollope novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Flushing</i>] I suppose you think I’m sentimental.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> No, but you’re pure nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’m not. [<i>Telephone bell rings</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> There goes the twentieth. Don’t you see how it makes you jump?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>has gone to the telephone</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Hullo! Hullo!... You rang <i>me</i> up. [<i>She hangs up the receiver</i>]
“Sorry you have been trubbled!” And it’s sure to be someone trying to
get on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> On Christmas morning? Hardly! I say, come along! The bells have
stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>In a strange voice</i>] Yes, they stopped when that other bell
rang.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Why, Mother, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Blindly</i>] They stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I told you, darling, you’re late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Give me my furs. I’m cold. [<span class="smcap">Gray</span> <i>helps her on with them</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Proud of her</i>] They <i>are</i> lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>At the door, wistfully</i>] It isn’t too good to be true, is
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> The furs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Everything! You&mdash;oh, what a fool I am! [<i>You hear</i> <span class="smcap">Gray’s</span>
<i>laugh answering hers as they go out together, and the sound of the
motor driving away</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Subsiding on to the sofa, to</i> <span class="smcap">Kit</span>, <i>who has come in as the
others go</i>] I thought they’d never get off. Mother has a way of standing
around and gently fussing&mdash;I tell you I’ll be glad when next week’s
over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> So’ll I. I haven’t had a look in lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>With an intimate glance</i>] Not last night? But it <i>has</i> been a
job, running Mother. I’m bridesmaid and best man and family lawyer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>
Juliet’s nurse all rolled into one&mdash;and a sort of lightning conductor
for Aunt Hester into the bargain. That’s why I’ve had so little time for
you. It’s quite true what Gray was saying just now&mdash;Mother <i>is</i>
nineteenth century. She’s sweet and helpless, but she’s obstinate too.
My word, the time she took making up her mind to get that divorce!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> It’s just about that that I’ve been wanting to talk to you. You
see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> You see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Hurry up, old thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well, you see, when I got home last night the governor was sitting
up for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> He would be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> And in the course of the row&mdash;<i>you</i> came in to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, but he likes me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Yes, he was quite soothed when I said we were engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Liar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Serenely</i>] Oh, well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>She finds his chuckle infectious</i>] What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Oh, lots of rot, of course, about being too young. But he was quite
bucked really until&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well, I was a fool. I said something, quite by chance, about your
father. Then the fur began<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> to fly. You see, it seems he thought your
mother was a widow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Ruffling up</i>] What’s it got to do with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well, you see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> If you’d only make me see instead of you-seeing me all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I’m afraid of hurting your feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I’m not nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Desperately</i>] Well, my people are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> That’s the trouble&mdash;my people are! Father promptly began about not
seeing his way to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> To what, Kit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> To&mdash;to marrying them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But I’ve never heard of anything so crazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Of course, you know, there’s nothing to worry about. There are
heaps of clergymen who will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> My dear boy, if Mother isn’t married in her own parish church
she’ll think she’s living in sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well, there it is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But look here, the old rector knew all about it. Do you mean to
say that a new man can come into our parish and insult Mother just
because his beastly conscience doesn’t work the same way the old
rector’s did? The divorce is perfectly legal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>In great discomfort</i>] Yes, Father knows all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> that. [<i>Hopefully</i>]
Of course, I don’t see myself why a registry office&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> If it were me I’d prefer it. Much less fuss. But Mother
wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> But she ought to see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But she won’t. It’s no use reckoning on what people ought to be.
You’ve got to deal with them as they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Guiltily</i>] Well, I’m awfully sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s no use being sorry. We’ve got to do something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Hopelessly</i>] When once the old man gets an idea into his head&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> He’d better not let it out in front of Mother. Gray’d half kill
him if he did. And I tell you this, Kit, what Gray leaves I’ll account
for, even if he is your father. Poor little Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well I’m all on your side, you know that. But of course, Sydney, a
clergyman needn’t re-marry divorced people. It’s in that bill. The
governor was quoting it to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But doesn’t he know the circumstances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> He only knows what I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> One doesn’t shout things at people, naturally. But it’s nothing
to be ashamed of. It’s only that my unfortunate father has been in an
asylum ever since I can remember. Shell-shock. It began before I was
born. He never came home again. Mother had to give up going to see him
even. It seemed to make him worse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Pretty tragic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, for years now he hasn’t known anyone, luckily. And he’s well
looked after. He’s quite all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Uncomfortably</i>] You’re a queer girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Yes&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Your own father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Impatiently</i>] My dear boy, I’ve never even seen him. Oh, of
course it’s very sad, but I can’t go about with my handkerchief to my
eyes all the time, can I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Yes&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I hate cant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Leaning over the back of the sofa, his hands playing with her
chain</i>] You little brute&mdash;you’re as hard as nails, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Putting up her face to him</i>] Am I? [<i>They kiss.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Passing through</i>] Really Sydney! Before lunch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> You know, old thing, sometimes I don’t feel as if I should ever
really get on with your aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Dimpling</i>] You’ll have to if&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Good Lord! You don’t want her in the house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Calmly</i>] I must take her off Mother sometimes. That’s only
fair. But she shan’t worry you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I say, you’re going to have things your own way, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But of course I am, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Heavily</i>] But look here&mdash;marriage is a sort of mutual show, isn’t
it? We’ve got to pull together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> But suppose we come to a cross-roads, so to speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well, somebody’ll have to give way, won’t they, darling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Hm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> My dear boy, if you want a door-mat you’d better look out for
someone&mdash;someone like poor dear Mother, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Wiser than he knows</i>] But you <i>are</i> like her, Sydney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Me? Do you think I’d let my daughter run me the way I run
Mother? Not much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Re-entering</i>] I think I left my&mdash; [<i>murmurs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Aside</i>] It’s no good. She’s doing this on purpose because I
cheeked her. You’d better go, old man. Besides, they must be well
through the anthem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Disturbed</i>] Good Lord! I should think I had better go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Going with him to the door</i>] I say, keep your father quiet
till I’ve had time to talk to Gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Right! [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Calling</i>] Kit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Reappearing</i>] Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Come round in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Right! [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Calling</i>] Kit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Reappearing</i>] Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I don’t suppose there’ll ever be any cross-roads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Darling! [<i>A scuffle.</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>reappears patting her hair</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I’m afraid I disturbed a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Sweetly</i>] Oh, Auntie, whatever made you think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> But I really couldn’t sit in the drawing-room. There’s
no fire. [<i>She sits down and opens her book</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>In a soft little voice, hums</i>] “When we are married we’ll have
sausages for tea.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Do you mind being quiet while I read the service?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Sorry! [<i>She takes up some knitting.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Tie for Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Sydney! Needlework on Sunday!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well, I can’t sit in the drawing-room either if there’s no
fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> There’s no need to lose your temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Out of patience</i>] Here, I’m going. [<i>As she makes for the
staircase the telephone gives a broken tinkle.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Sydney, I believe that telephone’s going off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes, I’m sure it’s someone trying to get on. They’ve rung up
once already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Sydney, I won’t be left to deal with it. [<i>The telephone
rings deafeningly.</i>] There, I told you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well, it’s not my fault! [<i>She takes off the receiver</i>] Hullo!
Hullo!... Yes.... Yes.... Yes.... [<i>To her aunt</i>] It’s a trunk call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Who on earth&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes.... Hullo!... Yes.... Mrs. Fairfield’s out. Shall I take a
message?... This is Miss Fairfield speaking.... All right, I’ll hold
on.... [<i>To her aunt</i>] Auntie, it’s from Bedford. It’s about Father.
[<i>Into the telephone</i>] Yes.... This is Miss Fairfield speaking....
What?... Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Sydney, don’t say “Good Lord”!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But you should have let Mrs. Fairfield know!... Only this
morning? Oh, I see.... No, we’ve heard nothing. When did you find
out?... What makes you&mdash;? I see.... No, he’s not here.... Of course we’d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span>let you know.... Then you’ll let us know at once if anything ...
yes.... <i>Miss</i> Fairfield. Mrs. Fairfield is going away very soon....
Thank you.... Good-bye.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>hangs up the receiver and turns round</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Father’s got away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> What? Who spoke to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> The head man&mdash;what’s his name? Rogers! Frightfully upset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I should think so. Why, the poor fellow’s dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Apparently he’s been very much better lately, and this last
week, a marked change, he says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Agitated</i>] You mean he’s getting well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Looks like it. Rogers was awfully guarded but&mdash;apparently they’d
already written to Uncle Hugh and the solicitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> They ought to have written to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Of course, they wouldn’t write to Mother&mdash;now&mdash;but we ought to
have heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> When did they miss him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> This morning. Then a lot about its being inexplicable and the
precautions they had taken and so on. The fact remains that he has
managed to get away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> It’s disgraceful carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Their theory is that he has suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> come to himself. Is it
possible, Auntie? Can it happen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> It’s quite possible. It does. It was the same with my
poor sister, Grace. After ten years that was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But the doctors said incurable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> The Almighty’s greater than the doctors. And
nerves&mdash;nerves are queer things. I nursed your Aunt Grace. Well, I
always told your mother to wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Struck</i>] Is that a fact about Aunt Grace? Was she out of her
mind too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> She never had to be sent away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Nobody ever told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> There’s something in most families.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But with Father&mdash;wasn’t it shell-shock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> It was brought on by shell-shock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> D’you mean that in our family there’s insanity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Fidgeting</i>] That’s not the way to talk. But we’re
nervy, all of us, we’re nervy. Your poor father would have been no worse
than the rest if it hadn’t been for the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Slowly</i>] What do you mean, “nervy”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>With a sidelong glance</i>] I mean the way you’re taking
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Sharply</i>] How am I taking it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Irritated</i>] Well, look at you now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Coldly</i>] I’m perfectly under control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> That’s it. It’s not natural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Slowly</i>] You mean, I shouldn’t bother to control myself if&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Hastily</i>] You’re too young to think about such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span>&mdash;if I weren’t afraid, you mean. Did Mother know&mdash;when she
married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I tell you there are troubles in every family, but one
doesn’t talk about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But did she <i>know</i> the trouble was insanity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Shortly</i>] I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Did Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> One always knows in a general sort of way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Relentlessly</i>] Am I nervy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Young people don’t have nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Insanity! A thing you can hand on! And I told Kit it was
shell-shock!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I don’t see what difference it makes to Christopher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You don’t see what difference&mdash;? You don’t see&mdash;? [<i>To herself</i>]
But <i>I</i> see [<i>There is a pause]</i> Aunt Hester, suppose Father really gets
well&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Whatever will he do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> It’s a question of what your mother will do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But it won’t have anything to do with Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Grimly</i>] Won’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> What on earth are you driving at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> I can’t discuss it with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> You’re too young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">SYDNEY.</span> I’m old enough to be engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> You’re not engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Insolently</i>] Kissed then. You saw that half an hour ago,
didn’t you? I might just as well say I can’t discuss it with you because
you’re too old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> How dare you speak to me like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Beside herself</i>] Oh, are all old people such stone walls?
Here’s a shadow, here’s a trouble, here’s a ghost in the house&mdash;and when
I ask you what shall I do, you talk about your blessed dignity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Rising</i>] This is the second time in one morning that
you have driven me out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Wringing her hands</i>] Well, I’m sorry! But I’m so worried.
Don’t you see I’ve got to keep it off Mother? and Kit! Oh, I’ve got to
tell Kit! [<i>Following her irresolutely</i>] Auntie, if you’d only be
decent. [<i>But</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield</span> <i>has gone out</i>. <span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>turns back into
the room</i>] If I only knew what to do!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>She stands hesitating. Then she goes to the telephone: makes a
movement as if to take it down but checks herself, shaking her
head. She comes back to the sofa at last and flings herself down on
it, fidgeting with the cushions and frowning. She is roused by the
click of a latch as the French window in the inner room is softly
opened, and</i> <span class="smcap">Hilary Fairfield</span> <i>steps over the threshold. He is a
big, fresh-coloured man with grey hair and bowed shoulders. In
speech and movements he is quick and jerky, inclined to be
boisterous, but pathetically easy to check. This he knows himself,
and he has, indeed, an air of being always in rebellion against his
own habit of obedience. He comes in, treading softly, his bright
eyes dancing with excitement, like a child getting ready to spring
a surprise on somebody. Something in the fashion of the empty room
(for he does not see</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>crouching in the cushions)
disconcerts him. He hesitates. The happy little smile fades. His
eye wanders from one object to another and he moves about,
recognising a picture here, fingering there an unfamiliar hanging,
as it were losing and finding himself a dozen times in his progress
round the room. He comes to a stand at last before the fire-place,
warming his hands. Then he takes out a pipe and with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>

you were&mdash;another girl. I’ve been away a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Whom do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Startled again</i>] There, you see, it’s her voice too. Who are
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Fencing</i>] How did you get in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Tool-shed gate. [<i>Louder</i>] Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Where have you come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Bedford. Took a car. [<i>Lashing himself into an agitation</i>] Who
are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Whom do you want to see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Losing all control</i>] Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Slowly</i>] I think I’m your daughter. [<span class="smcap">Hilary</span> <i>stares at her

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Daughter! Daughter! By God, that’s good! My wife isn’t my wife,
she’s my daughter! And my daughter’s seventeen and I’m twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You’re forgetting what years and years&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Yes, of course. It’s years and years. It’s a life-time. It’s my
daughter’s lifetime. What’s your name&mdash;daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Sydney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Sydney. Sydney, eh? My mother was Sydney. I like Sydney.
I&mdash; [<i>catching at his dignity</i>] I suppose we’re rather a shock to each
other&mdash;Sydney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> No. You’re not a shock to me. But I’m afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Breaking in</i>] Is my&mdash;? Is your&mdash;? Where’s Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> At church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Back soon, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Yes, that’s why I’m afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Unheeding</i>] I might go to meet her, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Quickly</i>] Oh, I wouldn’t. Come and sit down and wait for her
and talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Obediently</i>] Very well. [<i>He sits down beside her on the sofa.
They look at each other. He says shyly</i>] I say, isn’t this queer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It makes me want to cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Why? That’s all over. Laugh! Laugh! That’s the thing to do. What
a lovely room this is! I can’t say I like the new paper&mdash;or the
curtains!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Quickly</i>] Yes, I liked the old red ones, too. [<i>Then, with an
effort</i>] Those&mdash;aren’t&mdash;the only changes. Everything changes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Swiftly</i>] Bet you Aunt Hester hasn’t, eh? [<i>They look at each
other and laugh.</i>] And I bet you&mdash;I say, is your mother such a darling
still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Recalled to the business before her, brusquely</i>] Look
here&mdash;Father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Savouring it</i>] “Father!” “Father!” Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> We’ve got to talk. We’ve got to get things straight before she
comes back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>His eye and his attention beginning to wander</i>] Back soon, eh?
Why has Meg moved the clock? It was much better where we put it. Must
get it put back. Nearly one. She’s late, isn’t she? I&mdash;I really think,
you know, I’ll go out and meet your mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Authoritatively</i>] You’re to stay here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary</span>. [<i>Beginning obediently</i>] Very well&mdash; [<i>He flares suddenly</i>] I’ll
do as I like about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Passionately</i>] I’ll not have you frighten her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I? [<i>He smiles securely.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Can’t you realise what the shock&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Blissfully</i>] Never known anyone die of joy yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Father, you don’t understand! You and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Getting irritated</i>] Look here, this is nothing to do with
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But you mustn’t&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary</span> [<i>Violently</i>] Now I tell you I’m not going to be hectored. I
won’t stand it. I’ve had enough of it. D’you hear? I’ve had enough of
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> If you talk to my mother like this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Softening</i>] Meg understands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney</span> [<i>Jealously</i>] So do I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I believe you do. You got wild all in a moment. That’s my way,
too. It means nothing. Meg can’t see that it means nothing. But it makes
a man wild, you know, to be dragooned when he’s as sane as&mdash;my God, I
<i>am</i> sane! That’s all over, isn’t it? I am sane. Daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Watching him</i>] Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Don’t let me get&mdash;that way. It’s bad. Help me to go slow. I’m as
well as you are, you know. But it’s new. It only happened to-day&mdash;like a
curtain lifting. [<i>Confidentially</i>] You see I was standing in the
garden&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I can’t conceive how you got away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Led. Like Peter out of prison. I went through the gate, openly.
Their eyes were blinded. [<i>With a complete change of tone</i>] Pure luck,
you know. There were visitors going out&mdash;and I nipped along with them,
talking. No-one spotted me. I wouldn’t have believed it possible. Heaps
of us&mdash;of them, I mean&mdash;have tried, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But you’d no money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Whimsically</i>] I took the first taxi I saw. Promised him
double. He’s at the lower gate now, waiting to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Father, <i>dear</i>! Ticking away the tuppences! We’re not
millionaires!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Carelessly</i>] Your mother’ll see to it. [<i>Sound of a motor
horn</i>] That’s him! I suppose he’s got tired of waiting and come round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> No, no! That’ll be Mother. You mustn’t stop here. You must let
me tell her. You must let me tell her first. [<i>She goes out hurriedly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Your mother, is it? Your mother, eh? Here&mdash;child&mdash;a minute, give
me a minute! give me a minute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>As she comes in</i>] No&mdash;he couldn’t. But he’s coming round
directly after lunch&mdash;Hilary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Like a man who can’t see</i>] Meg! Is it Meg? Meg, I’ve come
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Terrified</i>] Sydney, don’t go away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s all right, Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Meg!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But they said&mdash;they said&mdash;incurable. They shouldn’t have
said&mdash;incurable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What does it matter? I’m well. I’m well, Meg! I tell you&mdash;it
came over me like a lantern flash&mdash;like a face turning to you. I was in
the garden, you know&mdash;lost. I was a lost soul&mdash;outcast! No hope. I can
never make anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> understand. I was never like the rest of them. I was
sane, always&mdash;but&mdash;the face was turned away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> What face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> The face of God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney&mdash;is he&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span>&mdash;It’s all right, Mother! That isn’t madness. He’s come to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Then&mdash;then&mdash;what am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What’s that? [<i>He comes nearer.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Staring at her</i>] You don’t say a word. One would think you
weren’t glad to see me. Aren’t you glad to see me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Of course&mdash;glad&mdash;you poor Hilary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> If you knew what it is to say to myself&mdash;I’m at home! That
place&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Mechanically</i>] Oh, but there was every comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Hell! Hell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Insisting</i>] But they were good to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Good enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>In acute distress</i>] They didn’t&mdash;ill-treat&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Mother, you know you did the very best&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> If it had been heaven&mdash;what difference does it make? I was a
dead man. Do you know what the dead do in heaven? They sit on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span>
golden chairs and sicken for home. Why did you never come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> They wouldn’t let me. It made you worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Because I wanted you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But you didn’t know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> My voice didn’t&mdash;and my speech and my actions didn’t. But <i>I</i>
knew you. Meg&mdash;behind the curtain&mdash;behind the dreams and the noises, and
the abandonment of God&mdash;I wanted you. I wanted&mdash;I wanted&mdash; [<i>He puts his
hand to his head.</i>] Look here&mdash;I tell you we mustn’t talk of these
things. It’s not safe, I tell you. When I talk I see a black hand
reaching up through the floor&mdash;do you see? there&mdash;through the widening
crack of the floor&mdash;to catch me by the ankle and drag&mdash;drag&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Father&mdash;Father&mdash;go slow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Terrified</i>] Sydney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s all right, Mother! We’ll manage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Turning to her</i>] Yes, you tell your mother. I’m all right! You
understand that, don’t you? Once it was a real hand. Now I know it’s in
my mind. I tell you, Meg, I’m well. But it’s not safe to think about
anything but&mdash;Oh, my dear, the holly and the crackle of the fire and the
snow like a veil of peace on me&mdash;and you like the snow&mdash;so still&mdash;</p>

<p class="c"><i>He comes to her with outstretched arms.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>Faintly</i>] No&mdash;no&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Exalted</i>] Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes! [<i>He catches her to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> For pity’s sake, Hilary&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Helplessly</i>] Sydney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Lay an extra cover. This&mdash;my&mdash;this gentleman is staying to
lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Boisterously</i>] Staying to lunch! to lunch! That’s a good joke,
isn’t it? I say, listen! I’m laughing. Do you know, I’m laughing? It’s
blessed to laugh. Staying to lunch! Yes, my girl! Lunch and tea and
supper and breakfast, thank God! and for many a long day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, no, Gray!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> It’s not pleasant, but it’s the only thing to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> There’s only one way to deal with an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But he’s not. He’s well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He’s well. He knows me. He&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Do you think I want to believe it? Oh, what a ghastly thing to
say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> This has nothing to do with you. He has nothing to do with you.
Leave me to deal with him. [<i>He goes towards the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> ’Phoning for Dr. Alliot to begin with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney’s done that already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Sydney’s head’s on her shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He’ll be here as soon as he can. He could always manage
Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You’d better go up to your room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Don’t take it too hard. It’ll be over in an hour. We’ll get him
away quietly, poor devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But it’s no good, Gray, he’s well. We’ve been on to the asylum
already. They say we should have heard in a day or two even if he hadn’t
got away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Really well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> The old Hilary&mdash;voice and ways and&mdash;oh, my God! what am I to
do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Do? You?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Don’t you see, he knows nothing? His hair’s grey and he talks
as he talked at twenty. It’s horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What do you mean, he knows nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> About the divorce. About you and me. He thinks it’s all&mdash;as he
left it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Incredulously</i>] You’ve said nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He’s like a lost child come home. Do you think I want to send
him crazy again? He&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>With a certain anger</i>] You’ve said nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You’ll come away with me at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I can’t. I’ve got to think of Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You’ve got to think of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I <i>am</i> you. But I’ve done him so much injury&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> <i>You’ve</i> done Fairfield injury? You little saint!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Saint? I’m a wicked woman. I’m wishing he hadn’t got well. I’m
wishing the doctors will say it’s not true. In my wicked heart I’m
calling down desolation on my own husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You have no husband. You’re marrying me in a week. You’re mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’m afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Whose are you? Answer me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You know it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Then never be afraid again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> No, not when you’re here. I’m not afraid when you’re here. But
I must be good to Hilary. You see that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> What good is “good” to him, poor devil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> At least I’ll break it gently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Gently? That’s just like a woman. All you can do for him is to
come away now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> How can I? He’s got to be told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Then let me tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> No, no! From you, just from you, it would be wanton. I won’t
have cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> We’ll go straight up to town and get married at once. That’ll
settle everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You mustn’t rush me. I’ve got to do what’s right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> It is right. There’s nothing else to be done. You can’t stay here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> No, I can’t stay here. Don’t let me stay here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Come with me. The car’s outside. You say Alliot will be here in
ten minutes. Leave him a note. He’s an old friend as well as a doctor.
Let him deal with it if you won’t let me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, can’t you see that I must tell Hilary myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Angrily</i>] Women are incomprehensible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s men who are uncomprehending. Can’t you feel that it’ll
hurt him less from me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> It’ll hurt him ten thousand times more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But differently. It’s the things one might have said that
fester. At least I’ll spare him that torment. He shall say all he wants
to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Blackly</i>] I suppose the truth is that there’s something in the
very best of women that enjoys a scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> That’s the first bitter thing you’ve ever said to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Breaking out</i>] Can’t you see what it does to me to know you are
in the same house with him? For God’s sake come out of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Close to him</i>] I want to come, now, this moment. I want to
be forced to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> That settles it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Eluding him</i>] But I mustn’t! Don’t you see that I mustn’t? I
can’t leave Sydney to lay my past for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> Your past is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Its ghost’s awake and walking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary’s Voice.</span> Meg! Meg!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Clinging to him</i>] Listen, it’s calling to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary’s Voice.</span> Meg, where are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s too late! I’m too old! I shall never get away from him. I
told you it was too good to be true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>Deliberately matter-of-fact</i>] Listen to me! I am going home now.
There are orders to be given. I must get some money and papers. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span> I
shall be back here in an hour. I give you just that hour to tell him
what you choose. After that you’ll be ready to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> If&mdash;if I’ve managed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> There’s no if. You’re coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Am I coming, Gray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Entering from the hall]</i> Meg, Sydney said you’d gone to your
room. Hullo! What’s this? Who’s this? Doctor, eh? I’ve been expecting
them down on me. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gray</span>] It’s no good, you know. I’m as fit as you
are. Any test you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Mr. Meredith called to see me, Hilary! He’s just going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Oh, sorry! [<i>He walks to the fire and stands warming his hands,
but watching them over his shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> [<i>At the door, in a low voice to</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>] I don’t like leaving
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You must! It’s better! But&mdash;come back quickly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span> You’ll be ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I will. [<span class="smcap">Gray</span> <i>goes out</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Uneasily</i>] Who’s that man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> His name’s Gray Meredith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What’s he doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He’s an old friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I don’t know him, do I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s since you were ill. It’s the last five years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> He’s in love with you! I tell you, the man’s in love with you!
Do you think I’m so dazed and crazed I can’t see that? You shouldn’t let
him, Meg! You’re such a child you don’t know what you’re doing when you
look and smile&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>In a strained voice</i>] I do know. [<i>She stands quite still in
the middle of the room, her head lifted, a beautiful woman.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Staring at her</i>] Lord, I don’t wonder at him, poor brute!
[<i>Still staring</i>] Meg, you’ve changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Catching at the opening</i>] Yes, Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Taller, more beautiful&mdash;and yet I miss something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Urging him on</i>] Yes, Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Wistfully</i>]&mdash;something you used to have&mdash;kind&mdash;a kind way with
you. The child’s got it. Sydney&mdash;my daughter, Sydney! She’s more you
than you are. You&mdash;you’ve grown right up&mdash;away&mdash;beyond me&mdash;haven’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes, Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But I’m going to catch up. You’ll help me to catch up with
you&mdash;Meg? [<i>She doesn’t answer.</i>] Meg! wait for me! Meg, where are you?
Why don’t you hold out your hands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Wrung for him</i>] I can’t, Hilary! My hands are full.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>His tone lightening into relief</i>] What,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> Sydney? She’ll be off
in no time. She’s told me about the boy&mdash;what’s his name&mdash;Kit&mdash;already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s not Sydney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What? [<i>Crescendo</i>] Eh? What are you driving at? What are you
trying to tell me? What’s changed you? Why do you look at me sideways?
Why do you flinch when I speak loudly? Yes&mdash;and when I kissed you&mdash;It’s
that man! [<i>He goes up to her and takes her by the wrist, staring into
her face.</i>] Is it true? You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Pitifully</i>] I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m trying to tell you.
I only want to tell you and make you understand. Hilary, fifteen years
is a long time&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Dully</i>] Yes. I suppose it’s a long time for a woman to be
faithful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> That’s it! That’s the whole thing! If I’d loved you it
wouldn’t have been long&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Violently, crying her down</i>] You did love me once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Beaten</i>] Did I&mdash;once? I don’t know&mdash;</p>

<p class="c"><i>There is a silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Without expression</i>] What do you expect me to do? Forgive you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Stung</i>] There’s nothing to forgive. [<i>Softening</i>] Oh, so
much, Hilary, to forgive each other; but not that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>More and more roughly as he loses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> control of himself</i>]
Divorce you then? Because I’ll not do that! I’ll have no dirty linen
washed in the courts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Forced into the open</i>] Hilary, I divorced you twelve months
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Shouting</i>] What? What? What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I divorced you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Beside himself</i>] You’re mad! You couldn’t do it! You’d no
cause! D’you think I’m to be put off with your lies? Am I a child? You’d
no cause! Oh, I see what you’re at. You want to confuse me. You want to
pull wool over my eyes. You want to drive me off my head&mdash;drive me mad
again. You devil! You devil! You shan’t do it. I’ve got friends&mdash;Sydney!
where’s that girl [<i>Shouting</i>] Sydney! Hester! All of you! Come here!
Come here, I say! [<span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>opens the drawing room door</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Mother, what is it? [<i>She enters, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield</span>.
<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hilary</span>&mdash;] What are you doing? You’re frightening her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Wildly</i>] No, no! You’re not on her side. You’re little
Sydney&mdash;kind&mdash;my Sydney! What did you say&mdash;go slow, eh! Keep your hand
here&mdash;cool, cool. [<i>Then as</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>, <i>breaking from him, makes a
movement to her mother</i>] Stand away from that woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney, humour him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>At white heat</i>] What was I calling you for, eh? Oh, yes, a
riddle. I’ve got a riddle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> you. There was a man at that place&mdash;used
to ask riddles&mdash;the moon told ’em to him. Just such a white face
whispering out of the blue&mdash;lies! He couldn’t find the answers&mdash;sent him
off his head. But I know the answer. When’s a wife not a wife, eh? Want
to know the answer? [<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>] When she’s
<i>this&mdash;this&mdash;this</i>! [<i>Confidentially</i>] She’s poisoning me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Now, Hilary! Hilary!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Sydney, come here! I’ll tell <i>you</i>. [<span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>stands torn between
the two</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> What have you done to him, Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’ve told him the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> God forgive you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Raving</i>] I tell you she’s pouring poison into my ear. You
remember that fellow in the play&mdash;and <i>his</i> wife? That’s what she’s
done. If I told you what she said to me, you’d think I was mad. And
that’s what she wants you to think. She wants to get rid of me. She’s
got a tame cat about the place. I’m in the way. And so she comes to me,
d’you see, and tells me&mdash;what do you think? She says she’s not my wife.
What do you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Grimly</i>] You may well ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>] He won’t listen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Sit down, darling! You’re shaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He’s always had these rages. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span>t’s my fault. I began at the
wrong end. Hilary&mdash;it’s not&mdash;I’m not what you think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Then what was that man doing in my house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> In a week I’m going to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> D’you hear her? To <i>me</i> she says this! Is she mad or am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Desperately</i>] I tell you there’s been a law passed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> No need for him to know that now, Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Of course he has to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Not now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>On the defensive</i>] I don’t know what you mean, Aunt Hester!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Let us rather thank God that he has come back in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Uneasy</i>] In time? In time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> To snatch a brand from the burning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’m a free woman. I’ve got my divorce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Whom God hath joined let no man put asunder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>At bay</i>] I’m a free woman. I’m going to marry Gray Meredith.
This is a trap! Sydney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Is this talk for a young girl to hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney, you’re to fetch Gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>With weak violence</i>] If he comes here I’ll kill him.</p>

to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It’s all right, Mother! We’ll manage somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> [<i>Entering</i>] Dr. Alliot is in the hall, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>With a gasp of relief</i>] Ask him to come in here. At once.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>Dr. Alliot trots in. He is a pleasant, roundabout, clean little
old man, with a twinkling face and brisk chubby movements of the
hands. He is upright and his voice is strong. He wears his seventy
odd years like a good joke that he expects you to keep up, in spite
of the fact that he is really your own age and understands you
better than you do yourself. But behind his comfortable manner is a
hint of authority which has its effect, especially on</i> <span class="smcap">Hilary</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Your memory’s all right I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Well, well, you see, you’ve arrived rather unconventionally.
I’ve been in touch with&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> That place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Why, yes! You may have to go back, you know. Formalities!
Formalities!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I don’t mind. I’m well. I’m well, Alliot! I’m not afraid of what
you’ll say. I’m not afraid of any of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Well, well, well! that sounds hopeful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But I can’t go yet, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Only for a day or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> It’s my wife. I lost my temper. I do lose my temper. It means
nothing. Go slow, eh? My wife’s ill, Doctor. She’s not right in her
head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Alert</i>] Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>With a wave of his hand</i>] So are the rest of them. Mad as

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Hm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Checked, glances at him keenly a moment. Then chuckling</i>] Oh,
you’re thinking that’s a delusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Humouring him</i>] Between you and me, it’s a common one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Half flattered</i>] Ah, we know, don’t we? Served in the same
shop, eh? Only the counter between us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Feeling his way</i>] Well, well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But look here! She says she’s not my wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Enlightened</i>] Oh! Oh, that’s the trouble!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> She says she’s not my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Soberly</i>] It’s a hard case, Fairfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What d’you mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> It’s the old wisdom of the scape-goat&mdash;it is expedient&mdash;how
does it go? expedient&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> “It is expedient that one man should die for the people.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> That’s it! A hard word, but a true one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> What has that got to do with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Well, the situation is this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> There is no situation. I married Meg. I fell ill. Now I’m well
again. I want my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Why, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Picking it up irritably</i>] “Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;” “Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;” I suppose
that’s what you call humouring a lunatic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Why, I hope to be convinced, Fairfield, that that trouble’s
over, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But you’re going to lock me up again because I want my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Patiently</i>] Will you let me put the case to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> You can put fifty cases. It makes no difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>At his elbow, softly</i>] Father, I’d listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Slipping his arm through hers</i>] Eh? Sydney? that you? You’re
not against me, Sydney?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Nobody’s against you. We only want you to listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Well, out with it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> D’you remember&mdash;can you throw your mind back to the
beginning of the agitation against the marriage laws? No, you were a
schoolboy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Deceased wife’s sister, eh? That’s the law that lets a man marry
his sister-in-law and won’t let a woman marry her brother-in-law. Pretty
good, that, for your side of the counter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Well, well, that hardly matters now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> It shows what your rotten, muddle-headed laws are worth, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> All right! Go ahead! Go ahead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Well, as the result of that agitation&mdash;and remember, Hilary,
what thousand, thousand tragedies must have had voice in such an
outcry&mdash;a commission was appointed to enquire into the working of the
divorce laws. It made its report, recommended certain drastic reforms,
and there, I suppose, as is the way with commissions, would have been
the end of the subject, if it hadn’t been for the war&mdash;and the war
marriages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Lowering</i>] So that’s where I come in! Margaret, is that where
I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Never, I suppose, in one decade were there so many young
marriages. Happy? that’s another thing! Marry in haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> They weren’t all happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> But they were <i>young</i>, those boys and girls who married. As
young as Kit, and as impatient as Sydney. And that saved them. That
young, young generation found out, out of their own unhappiness, the war
taught them, what peace couldn’t teach us&mdash;that when conditions are evil
it is not your duty to submit&mdash;that when conditions are evil, your duty,
in spite of protests, in spite of sentiment, your duty, though you
trample on the bodies of your nearest and dearest to do it, though you
bleed your own heart white, your duty is to see that those conditions
are changed. If your laws forbid you, you must change your laws. If your
church forbids you, you must change your church; and if your God forbids
you, why then, you must change your God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> And we who will not change?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Or cannot change&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Stifle. Like a snake that can’t cast its skin. Grow or
perish&mdash;it’s the law of life. And so, when this young generation&mdash;yours,
not mine, Hilary&mdash;decided that the marriage laws were, I won’t say evil,
but outgrown, they set to work to change them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> You needn’t think it was without protest, Hilary. I
joined the anti-divorce league myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> No, it wasn’t without protest. Mrs. Grundy and the churches
are protesting still. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> in spite of protest, no man or woman to-day
is bound to a drunkard, an habitual criminal, or&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Or&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Or to a partner who, as far as we doctors know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But you can’t be sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> I say as far as we know, is incurably insane&mdash;in practice,
is insane for more than five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> And if he recovers? Look at me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>With a sigh</i>] “It is expedient&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> And you call that justice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> At least call it mercy. All the days of your life to stand at
the window, Hilary, and watch the sun shining on the other side of the
road&mdash;it’s hard, it’s hard on a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> At least call it common sense. If a man can’t live his
normal life, it’s as if he were dead. If he’s an incurable drunkard, if
he’s shut away for life in prison&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But I’m not a drunkard. I’m not a convict. I’ve done nothing.
I’ve been to the war, to fight, for her, for all of you, for my country,
for this law-making machine that I’ve called my country. And when I’ve
got from it, not honourable scars, not medals and glory, but sixteen
years in hell, then when I get out again, then the country I’ve fought
for, the laws I’ve fought for, the woman I’ve fought for, they say to
me, “As you’ve done without her for fifteen years you can do without<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>
her altogether.” That’s what it is. When I was helpless they conspired
behind my back to take away all I had from me. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>] Did I
ever hurt you? Didn’t I love you? Didn’t you love me? Could I help being
ill? What have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> You died, Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Sydney, don’t be cruel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Ah, we cry after the dead, but I’ve always wondered what
their welcome back would be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Well, you know now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> I don’t say it isn’t hard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Ah, you don’t say it isn’t hard. That’s good of you. That’s
sympathy indeed. And my wife&mdash;she’s full of it too, isn’t she? “Poor
dear! I was married to him once. I’d quite forgotten.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> For pity’s sake, Hilary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Why, face it, man! One of you must suffer. Which is it to
be? The useful or the useless? the whole or the maimed? the healthy
woman with her life before her, or the man whose children ought never to
have been born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>In terrible appeal</i>] Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Is that true, Dr. Alliot? Is that true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Her voice shaking</i>] I think you go too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Mrs. Fairfield, in this matter I cannot go too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> For me, at any rate&mdash;too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> and too fast altogether!
Before ladies! It’s not nice. It’s enough to call down a judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> [<i>Entering</i>] Mr. Pumphrey to see you, ma’am. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>] And
Mr. Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Justified</i>] Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I can’t see anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> He said, ma’am, it was important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Who? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> The Rector. I expect he’s heard about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I can’t see him. I won’t see him. Let me go. I’ve met the
Levites. Spare me the priest. [<i>He breaks away from them and goes
stumbling out at the other door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Following him anxiously</i>] Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Preventing her</i>] No, no, my child! I’ll look after him.
[<i>He goes out quickly.</i>]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Rector</span> <i>is an insignificant man, with an important manner and

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Ah, good afternoon, Mrs. Fairfield&mdash;Miss Fairfield&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Mechanically. She is very tired and inattentive</i>] A happy
Christmas, Mr. Pumphrey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Ah! Just so! Christmas afternoon. An unusual day to call, Mrs.
Fairfield, and, I fear, an inconvenient hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Not at all, Mr. Pumphrey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I can give myself [<i>he takes out his watch</i>] till three fifteen,
no longer. The children’s service is at three thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Turning to the bell</i>] Mayn’t I order you an early cup of
tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Thank you, thank you, no. Busy as I am, I should not have
disturbed you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Rector, it’s as if you had been sent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Ah! gratifying! I did not see you at the morning service, Miss
Fairfield. But last night&mdash;<i>late</i> last night&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>With a look at</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>] Three A.M., Rector?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Three fifteen, Miss Fairfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Look here, Father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I received certain information from my son&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> No, you don’t, Father. I’ll have my say first. It’s just this, Mrs.
Fairfield&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>Fussed</i>] Christopher? Christopher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>He is very much in earnest and he addresses himself solely to</i>
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span>] I want you to know that it is nothing to do with me, Mrs.
Fairfield. I don’t agree with my father. [<i>Confidentially</i>] You wouldn’t
think it but I never do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Christopher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Ignoring him</i>] And it was only coming up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> the drive that he
sprung on me why he wanted to see you, or I wouldn’t have come&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Liking him</i>] I think Sydney would have been sorry, Kit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>With a touch of his father’s manner</i>] Yes, well, Sydney and I
have talked it over&mdash;and I know I’m going into the church myself&mdash;but I
think he’s all wrong, Mrs. Fairfield. [<i>Unconscious of plagiarism</i>] I’m
not nineteenth century. [<i>But</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span> <i>giggles</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Rector, what’s the matter with the young man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Forging ahead</i>] You see, I’m pretty keen about Sydney, and so,
naturally, I’m pretty keen about you, Mrs. Fairfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Miss Fairfield, I’m without words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Burdened</i>]&mdash;and I just wanted to tell you that I can’t tell you
what I think of my father over this business. It makes me wild.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Kit, you’d better shut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>] Well, I only wanted her to understand that
I’m not responsible for my father&mdash;that he’s not my own choice, if you
know what I mean. [<i>They talk aside.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> His mother’s right hand! I don’t know what’s come over him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Grimly</i>] A pretty face, Rector!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Ah! the very point! I shall be glad to see you alone, Mrs.
Fairfield&mdash;not you, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> Miss Fairfield, but&mdash;er&mdash; [<i>He glances
at</i> <span class="smcap">Kit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sydney</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Resignedly</i>] Sydney, have you shown Kit all your presents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Reluctantly taking the hint, but continuing the conversation
as they go out</i>] What did you let him come for? Oh, you’re no good!
[<i>The door bangs behind them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Half smiling</i>] Well, Mr. Pumphrey, I suppose it’s about
Sydney and Kit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Fairfield, until last night we encouraged, we were
gratified&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Last night? Oh, the dance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I sat up for my son until three fifteen of Christmas morning.
His excuse was your daughter&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>With dignity</i>] Do you take objection to Sydney, Mr.
Pumphrey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Now, my dear lady, you mustn’t misunderstand me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Quietly</i>] To me, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Fairfield, I beg&mdash;But in the course of a
slight&mdash;er&mdash;altercation between Christopher and myself it transpired&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>She has been prepared for it</i>] I see, it’s her father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I am grieved&mdash;grieved for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But his illness was no secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> My heart, Mrs. Fairfield, and Mrs. Pumphrey’s heart has gone out
to you in your affliction. When the light of reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Then you did know. <i>Then</i> I don’t follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> But according to Christopher&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Fairfield, is your husband alive or dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> My former husband is alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>With a half deprecatory, half triumphant gesture</i>] Out of your
own mouth, Mrs. Fairfield&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Bewildered</i>] But you say you knew he was insane?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> But I didn’t know he was alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Irritated</i>] Don’t be so foolish, Margaret. It’s not
the insanity, it’s the divorce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> When I realised that I had been within a week of re-marrying a
divorced person&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Coldly</i>] Why didn’t you go to Mr. Meredith?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mr. Meredith is&mdash;er&mdash;a difficult man to&mdash;er&mdash;approach. I felt
that an appeal to your feelings, as a Christian, as a mother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You mean you’ll prevent Kit marrying Sydney&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> It depends on you, Mrs. Fairfield. I won’t let him marry the
child of a woman who remarries while her husband is alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But the church allows it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> [<i>Correcting her</i>] Winks at it, Margaret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>With dignity</i>] “Winks” is hardly the word&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Then what word would you use, Mr. Pumphrey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I am not concerned with words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But I want to know. I care about my church. It lets me and it
doesn’t let me&mdash;what does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>Much moved</i>] I am not concerned with meanings, Mrs. Fairfield.
I am concerned with my own conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Margaret&mdash;you’ve no business to upset the Rector. Why
don’t you tell him that the situation has changed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Nothing has changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Changed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> My nephew has recovered&mdash;returned. He’s in the house
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Providence! It’s providence! [<i>With enthusiasm</i>] I never knew
anything like providence. Changed indeed, Miss Fairfield! My objection
goes. Dear little Sydney! Ah, Mrs. Fairfield, in a year you and your
husband will look back on this&mdash;episode as on a dream&mdash;a bad dream&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Stonily</i>] I have no husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Ah! the re-marriage&mdash;a mere formality&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Simpler still&mdash;the decree can be rescinded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Stunned</i>] Aunt Hester, knowing his history, knowing mine, is
it possible that you expect me to go back to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> He’s come back to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> A wife’s duty&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Slowly</i>] I think you’re wicked. I think you’re both wicked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Fairfield!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> Control yourself, Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>With a touch of wildness in her manner</i>] You&mdash;do you love
your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Fairfield!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> Mrs. Pumphrey and I&mdash;most attached&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Suppose you weren’t. Think of it&mdash;to want so desperately to
feel&mdash;and to feel nothing. Do you know what it means to dread a person
who loves you? To stiffen at the look in their eyes? To pity
and&mdash;shudder? You should not judge.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hilary</span>, <i>unseen, opens the door and shuts it again quickly</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield.</span> There it is, you see, Rector! She doesn’t care <i>what</i>
she says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Gravely, holding the door behind him</i>] Margaret, my
child&mdash; [<i>He sees the others and his voice changes</i>] Hullo, Pumphrey! You
here still? Well, well&mdash;you’re cutting it fine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> The service! [<i>He pulls out his watch, stricken.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> I’ll run you down there if you’ll wait a minute. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, <i>privately, poking a wise forefinger</i>] What you want, my
child, is a good cry and a cup of tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>Coming up to</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, <i>stiffly</i>] Goodday, Mrs. Fairfield!
You will not&mdash;reconsider&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I will not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> I regret&mdash;I regret&mdash; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield</span>] My dear lady, you have
my sympathy. I think I left my hat&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Miss Fairfield</span> <i>escorts him into

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Hilary’s coming home with me, Margaret. He wants a word with
you first. Can you manage that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>Abruptly</i>] Where’s Meredith?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Eagerly</i>] He’s coming. He’s taking me away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Good. The sooner the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rector.</span> [<i>Reappearing at the door</i>] Dr. Alliot&mdash;it now wants seven
minutes to the half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> Coming! Coming! See now&mdash;you can be gentle with him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Alliot.</span> [<i>With a keen look at her</i>] Nor yet too gentle. Well, well,
God be with you, child! [<i>He trots out.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hilary</span> <i>comes in, hesitating. If he is without dignity, he is,

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Have they gone? [<i>Reassuring her</i>] It’s all right. I’m going
too. [<i>He waits for her to answer. She says nothing</i>] I’m going. I’ve

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Dr. Alliot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I’m going to stay with him till I can look round. He’s going to
make it right with that place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’m glad you’ve got a good friend, Hilary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Yes, he’s a good chap. He’s talked to me. He’s made me see. [<i>He
comes a little closer.</i>] He says&mdash;and I do see&mdash;It’s too late, of
course&mdash; [<i>his look at her is a petition, but she makes no sign</i>] isn’t
it? [<i>He comes nearer.</i>] Yes&mdash;it’s too late. It wouldn’t be fair&mdash;to ask
you&mdash; [<i>again the look</i>] would it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Imploringly</i>] Oh, Hilary, Hilary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>Encouraged to come closer</i>] No woman could be expected&mdash;you
couldn’t be expected&mdash; [<i>she makes no sign</i>] could you? [<i>Repeating his
lesson</i>] It’s what he says&mdash;you’ve made a new life for yourself&mdash; [<i>he
waits</i>] haven’t you? There’s no room in it&mdash;for me&mdash;is there? [<i>He is
close to her. She does not move.</i>] So it’s just a case of&mdash;saying
good-bye and going, because&mdash;because&mdash;I quite see&mdash;there’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>no
chance&mdash; [<i>Suddenly he throws himself down beside her, catching at her
hands, clinging to her knees</i>] Oh! Meg, Meg, Meg! isn’t there just a
chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Faintly</i>] Hilary, I can’t stand it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>And from now to the end of the scene he is at full pelt,

You don’t listen. Listen to me! I’ve been alone so long&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Gray! Gray! Why don’t you come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> I’ll not trouble you. I’ll not get in your way&mdash;but&mdash;don’t leave
me all alone. Give me something&mdash;the rustle of your dress, the cushion
where you’ve lain&mdash;your voice about the house. You can’t deny me such
little things, that you give your servant and your dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It’s madness&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> It’s naked need!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What good should I be to you? I don’t love you, Hilary&mdash;poor
Hilary. I love him. I never think of anything but him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But it’s me you married. You promised&mdash;you promised&mdash;better or
worse&mdash;in sickness in health&mdash;You can’t go back on your promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It isn’t fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> Anything’s fair! You don’t know what misery means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I’m learning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> But you don’t <i>know</i>. You couldn’t leave me to it if you knew.
Why, I’ve never known you hurt a creature in all your life! Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span>
the rat-hunts in the barn, the way we used to chaff you? and the
starling? and the kitten you found? Why, I’ve seen you step aside for a

yesterday come back again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>In the toils</i>] No&mdash;no! Hilary, I can’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilary.</span> [<i>At white heat</i>] No, you can’t. You can’t leave me. You can’t
do it to me. You can’t drive me out&mdash;the

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> Very well, ma’am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Auntie, I know Mother won’t want to be disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bassett.</span> He didn’t stay out with us, miss. Him and the puppy together

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> All about nothing. Sorry, my old Kit, sorry! [<i>She flings

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I told you it all this morning. What’s yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I like yours better. How’s the pamphlet going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Nearly done. I put in all your stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Absently</i>] Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Though you know, I don’t agree with it. What I feel is&mdash;you’re not

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Slowly</i>] Kit, talking of that paper&mdash;I read somewhere&mdash;suppose
now&mdash;is it true it can skip a generation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> It? What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh&mdash;any illness. Consumption or&mdash;well, say insanity.
Suppose&mdash;<i>you</i>, for instance&mdash;suppose you were a queer family&mdash;a little,
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> know. Say your mother or your father was queer&mdash;and you weren’t.
You were perfectly fit, you understand, perfectly fit&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> What about the children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I wouldn’t risk it. Thank the Lord your father’s only shell-shock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> You can’t pass on shell-shock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Then you can pass on insanity&mdash;even if you’re fit yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Of course you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It would be very wicked, wouldn’t it&mdash;to children? Oh, it would
be wicked. I suppose when people are in love they don’t think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Won’t think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But isn’t there a school that says there’s no such thing as
heredity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well, all I know is I wouldn’t risk it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> It&mdash;it’s hard on people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> My word, yes. They say that’s why old Alliot never married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>High and mightily</i>] Oh, village gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Apologetically</i>] Well, you know what the mater is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Abandoning her dignity</i>] Who was it, Kit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Old Miss Robson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Rot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> But she’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Had a game sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Of course! I just remember her. She used to scare me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Oh, it must be true. They’re such tremendous pals still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Poor old things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Rotten for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Rottener for him! What did she go on being pals with him for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Why shouldn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well it stopped him marrying anyone else. She oughtn’t to have
let him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> You can’t stop a person being fond of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> When it’s a man you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> My dear girl, you don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> My dear boy, if a girl finds out that it’s not right for her to
marry a man, it’s up to her to choke him off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Rot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Well, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Couldn’t be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Couldn’t it just?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Any man would see through it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> As if any man ever saw through anything! As if I couldn’t choke
you off in five minutes if I wanted to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I’d like to see you try!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Would you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> My dear girl, we’re not all fools where women are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I admire your air of conviction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Don’t be clever-clever, old thing. Be&mdash; [<i>His arm slips round her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Edging away</i>] Don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>He glances round hastily at</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, <i>but she is deep in
writing</i>.] Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Deliberately</i>] I hate being pawed. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Look here, Sydney, d’you call this a way of spending Christmas
afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Her lip quivering</i>] It isn’t much of a way, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Well then, old thing! [<i>Again the arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Icily</i>] I told you to leave me alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Rising, huffed</i>] Oh, well, if you can’t be decent, I’m going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Sweetly</i>] Counter attraction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Wheeling round on her</i>] Now, my dear old thing, look here. I know
it’s only a sort of way you’ve got into; but when you say&mdash;“men!”&mdash;with
a sort of sneer, and “other attractions”&mdash;like that, in that voice, it
just sounds cheap. I hate it. It’s not like you. I wish you wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Now I suppose you’re annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, no, I’m only amused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Heavily</i>] There’s nothing amusing about me, Sydney. I’m in
earnest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I’m sure you are. You got out of answering an innocent little

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Harried</i>] Now, look here, Sydney, I swear to you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Like the ghost in Hamlet</i>] Swear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> If you’re thinking of Alice Hewitt I’ve only met her four times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, so her name’s Alice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Didn’t you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Never heard of her till this minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Then what on earth have you been driving at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Trying an experiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> If it’s because you’re jealous&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Jealous! Jealous of a&mdash;What colour are her eyes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Carelessly</i>] How’d I know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>With a sudden spurt of suspicion</i>] Kit! What colour are mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Helplessly</i>] Oh, er&mdash;oh&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Terribly</i>] Kit! What colour are mine? [<i>Relenting</i>] Look at my
frock, you donkey! What do you suppose I wear blue for? So Alice has got
blue eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> I know you, Kit. You’re conservative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> As a matter of fact, she isn’t unlike you. That’s what made me talk
to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, you’ve talked to her?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Warming</i>] Oh, yes&mdash;quite a lot. She’s a friend of my sister’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> She always is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> What d’you mean&mdash;“she always is”? I tell you I’ve only met her four
times. I can’t make you out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I wish I could make you out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>An ache in her voice</i>] Oh, I wish you could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Responding instantly</i>] I say, old thing, is anything really the
matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>With a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>] I’m worried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Oh, that! Yes, it’s beastly for your mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, it’s not that. At least&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Lightly</i>] Oh, I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Puzzled</i>] Can’t you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> No, old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>As in</i> <span class="smcap">Act. I.</span>] But&mdash;look here&mdash;marriage has got to be a sort of

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Oh, no, Kit, she’s got blue eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Storming</i>] Look here, what’s up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Once and for all, Sydney, will you shut up about Alice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Can’t. It’s her jam to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> I wish you’d talk sense for a change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> Tired of jam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> But what have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Flaring effectively</i>] Well, for one thing you shouldn’t have
told your father we were engaged. What girl, do you suppose, would stand
it? You ask Alice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> [<i>Egging him on</i>] Good for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> [<i>Furious</i>] And if I do I’ll ask her more than that.</p>

Strike while the iron’s hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> You’re mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> [<i>Sitting down, with a listless gesture</i>] I must. There’s no
way out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney.</span> There is. For <i>you</i> there is. I’ve thought it all along, and now
